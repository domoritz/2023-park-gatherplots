In (a), there is enough space so that the dot size can be maximized, improving spatial accuracy. In comparison, in (b) the assigned space is small, so the dot size is determined so that the most crowded bin interval will fit within the assigned space. This results in two different overviews even though the two plots have identical aspect ratio.","key":"fig-optimal-bin"},{"order":{"number":1,"section":[0,0,0,8,0,0,0]},"caption":"Cars dataset. Gatherplots showing a dataset related to cars, yielding overplotting in normal scatterplots. The gatherplot in (a) shows Cylinders (categorical) vs. MPG (continuous), highlighting the overall distribution of MPG values of cars with different cylinders. The brackets on the X-axis are used to indicate that the interval within the brackets represent the same value in the data. The gatherplot in (b) shows Cylinders (categorical) vs. Origin (categorical), partitioning the graphical axes into intervals and packing points into groups for each interval. In (c), both X-axis and Y-axis show the same continuous variable (MPG). All these cases would have caused overplotting for a scatterplot, resulting in dot-shaped or line-shaped point patterns where individual points cannot be identified.","key":"fig-teaser"},{"order":{"number":4,"section":[0,2,5,0,0,0,0]},"caption":"Main layout modes for gatherplots. (a) absolute mode with constant aspect ratio, which maintains the aspect ratio; (b) normalized mode of (a). The rate of male survivors in each passenger class is not easy to compare.
